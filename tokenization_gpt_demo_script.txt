🎬 Video Walkthrough Script: Tokenization & Toy GPT Demo

🎙️ Intro Slide / Start Recording
Hello! My name is [Your Name], and in this short demo, I’ll walk you through the second task of my LLM internship — which includes:
1. An overview of tokenization techniques,
2. A toy GPT model I built from scratch in PyTorch,
3. And a live demo of generating text using that model.

📘 Part 1: Tokenization Summary Slide
Let’s begin with a quick summary of tokenization.

Tokenization is how we break text into small pieces — like words or subwords — so language models can understand and process them.

We explored three main techniques:
- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE): It merges frequent character pairs to form subword units.
- WordPiece: Used in BERT, it uses likelihood to choose subword splits.
- SentencePiece: Language-agnostic and works directly on raw text, great for multilingual models.

These techniques help balance vocabulary size and model performance.

🧠 Part 2: GPT Architecture Slide or Diagram
Now, let’s look at the core of the GPT model.

GPT uses a decoder-only Transformer architecture, with:
- Token embeddings: To turn tokens into vectors
- Positional encodings: So the model knows token order
- Masked self-attention: So it only looks at previous tokens
- Feedforward layers: To learn complex patterns
- And a final output layer to predict the next token.

The training goal is simple: Predict the next token given previous ones.

💻 Part 3: Code Walkthrough Screen Share
Now I’ll show you the actual Python code I wrote.

I created a toy dataset: the sentence ‘To be or not to be.’

Using PyTorch, I defined a simple model:
- An embedding layer
- A linear output head
- And a generate() function to autoregressively produce text.

Let’s run the model now…

As you can see, the model generates new text starting from the letter 'T'. It learns basic structure like word flow and punctuation even from a tiny dataset.

🧪 Part 4: Output Example
Here's an example of generated text:
> ‘To be or nor bo ot to’

This isn’t perfect, but considering how tiny the dataset and model are, it’s a great start and shows the core principles of how GPT works.

🎯 Outro Slide
To summarize:
- I explored tokenization fundamentals,
- Implemented a mini GPT model from scratch,
- And demonstrated its training and text generation.
